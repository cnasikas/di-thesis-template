If the Arial font family is not installed in your system, copy the font
directory under your home directory and make it hidden. That is, simply
execute the following command.

	mv fonts ${HOME}/.fonts

Alternatively, if you are working in Linux, installing the package 
`msttcorefonts` will provide you with the Arial TrueType font family. In
Ubuntu, you may install them with the following command:
	sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer

Instructions on installing the outerjoin symbol. You probably do not need the
outerjoin symbol, so you can skip the following instructions.

1. Copy this directory to your HOME directory.
	cp -r texmf ~/

   If you want to change this directory, i.e., to make it hidden, then follow
   the following steps:
     a. Update the TEXMFHOME variable in the file `texmf.cnf'. To find this file
        simply execute the following command:
		locate texmf.cnf

        In Linux, it should be under directory /etc.
   
        Variable TEXMFHOME should be assigned the value `~/.texmf'.

     b. Make sure that the TeX distribution is aware of the changes by checking
        whether the output of the following command.
		kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFHOME

     c. After doing this, run the following command:
		texhash ~/.texmf
